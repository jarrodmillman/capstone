Day 2: Text Mining (Functions)
******************************

Today I will assign everyone to teams for the first project and you will
have time at the end of the class to meet.

We will work through the following example::

In this example, we will look at several different ways you might implement
the function ``all_punct()``.  We will discuss Python docstrings and
doctests.  We will also do some simple timing using IPython's ``timeit``.
We will discuss the trade-off between readability and speed.  Finally,
we will take a brief look at Python's regular expression facililities.
