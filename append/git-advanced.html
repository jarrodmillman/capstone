<p>In groups, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a> I want you to spend about 5 minutes on each of the
following questions. For most of the questions, you will need to use Git
and GitHub.</p>
<p>While you are discussing things, I will circulate among the groups to
answer questions and observe. After working on each question for 5
minutes in groups, we will have a class discussion for about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>So far you’ve only needed to use Git in the most basic way. As you
begin using Git in more advanced ways, you will increasingly need to
have a clear understanding of the underlying model. Otherwise things
will be confusing.</p>
<p>In the (9/7/2014) section on Git, I introduced several concepts.
Before actually doing anything new with Git, take some time to recall
the definition of the following concepts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Working tree</li>
<li>Commit</li>
<li>Repository</li>
<li>Remotes</li>
<li>Branch</li>
<li>Tag</li>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Staging area</li>
<li>Pushing and pulling</li>
</ol>
<p>How do these things relate to the DAG (i.e., directed acyclic graph)
that we talked about in section? Where does hashing come into play?
Why does Git hash? How do the Git commands that you’ve been using
(e.g., status, log, clone, add, commit, push, pull, rm, mv) relate to
these concepts?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="collaboration-remotes-and-merging-work-in-pairs">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Collaboration: remotes and merging (work in pairs)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#collaboration-remotes-and-merging-work-in-pairs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Work in pairs for the following. You should each be on your own
computer, but take turns watching each other type and talking through
what you are doing as you work through the questions together.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Clone my example stats repository. Change into your local
repository and view your remotes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a new public repository on GitHub called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats</span></code>. (Make
sure not to initialize it. Explain why?)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add your GitHub repository as a remote.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Push your local repository to your GitHub repository. First,
verify the status of your repository. Now push the master branch
of your local repository to your empty repository on GitHub. The
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-u</span></code> option will set your master branch of your local repository
to track remote branch master from my.</p>
<p>Now check the status of your repository. Did anything change? If
so, can you explain why?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add your partner’s GitHub repository as a remote.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Verify that you can execute the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.R</span></code> file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">At this point randomly choose one of you to be person A and the
other to be person B.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now both of you will edit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.R</span></code>.</p>
<p>You will see <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#!/bin/Rscript</span></code> at the top of your file. I removed
it above because <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">knitr</span></code> wasn’t correctly rendering it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person A).</strong> Change the following lines from to Then add and
commit your changes to your local repository. Push your changes
to GitHub. What remote did you push to? Did you have to
specify? Why or why not?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person B).</strong> After your partner has completed the above
steps, change the following line from to Now add and commit
your changes to your local repository. Push your changes to
GitHub. What remote did you push to? Did it conflict with what
Person A did previously? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Next merge your partner’s changes into your local repository.
To make the two-steps taken by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code> explicit, you will
type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">fetch</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span></code> separately. Why did you
need to specify <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">their/master</span></code>? What happened to the status?
What was the most recent commit before and after you did the
pull (i.e., fetch+merge)?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person A).</strong> Merge your partner’s changes into your local
repository.</p>
<p>Why did you need to specify <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">their/master</span></code>? How come both you
and Person B typed <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">their/master</span></code>? Where you referring to the
same repository/branch? What happened to the status? What was
the most recent commit before and after you did the pull (i.e.,
fetch+merge)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now let’s see what happens when there is a merge conflict. both of
you will edit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.R</span></code>.</p>
<p>You will see <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#!/bin/Rscript</span></code> at the top of your file. I removed
it above because <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">knitr</span></code> wasn’t correctly rendering it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person A).</strong> Change the following lines from to Then add and
commit your changes to your local repository. Push your changes
to GitHub. What remote did you push to? Did you have to
specify? Why or why not?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person B).</strong> After your partner has completed the above
steps, change the following line from to Add and commit your
changes to your local repository. Push your changes to your
repository on GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person A and Person B).</strong> Merge your partner’s changes into
your local repository.</p>
<p>Take a closer look to see what’s happening. Git is telling you
that you have a merge conflict. In other words, Git does not
know whether <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> should be <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1:50</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1:60</span></code>. So it wasn’t
able to automatically merge the changes that Person A and
Person B did. Instead it added both changes to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.R</span></code> as
well as some additional mark up to indicate what happened.
Let’s look at what happened to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.R</span></code>.</p>
<p>Person A should see something like this: Person B should see
something like this: Make sure you both see something like
this. Can you see what happened?</p>
<p>A curious, but common mistake for new users is to just commit
the file with the text that Git inserted. Why is this a
mistake?</p>
<p>Rather than trying to commit the invalid code, you will need to
resolve the conflict and then commit the resolved code. To
resolve this merge conflict, you will need to decided what the
correct code should be. For example, you might want to edit
your file (using whatever text editor you wish) as follows:</p>
<p>Once you’ve corrected the file as you wish, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[2]</a> you can check
the status to help remind you what you need to do.</p>
<p>Now use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> to let Git know you’ve resolved the
conflict and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code> to finish the merge.</p>
<p>Now you should both be able to push your local repository to
your GitHub remote.</p>

</ul>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Collaboration: using branches (read and discuss in small groups)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#collaboration-using-branches-read-and-discuss-in-small-groups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recall that branches <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[3]</a> are movable labels to a commit. The labels
move forward as you make new commits. When you create a Git
repository, the default branch is given the name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>. This is
just a convention (i.e., you can change that name, if you have a good
reason to—you probably don’t).</p>
<p>Why would you use more than one branch? Typically, people use their
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch to point to the current, bug-vetted, feature
complete version of their project. New features, bug fixes, and
experimental exploration are all done on other branches. Once a
feature is implemented, a bug is fix, or an experimental exploration
pans out, the branch where this work was performed is merged back
into the master branch. The advantage of this is that the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>
branch remains in a known, good state. Why might such a pattern of
use be helpful? Would this slow you down? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Now that you’ve recalled what a branch is and started thinking about
what you might use them for, let’s see how you list, create, and
merge branches.</p>
<p>First, to see what branches you have you can type: Imagine you create
a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">testing</span></code> branch. Now you will have two branches. The asterik
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">*</span></code> beside the label <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> indicates that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> is the
current branch. What does that mean? What will happen if you make a
new commit while on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch?</p>
<p>Before discussing how you change what branch you are currently
working on or learning how to merge branches, it is helpful to
understand a bit about how Git keeps track of what branch you are on.
In Figure&nbsp;[fig:1], you can see a schematic representation of the
situation you are currently in (i.e., you just added your second
branch <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">testing</span></code> and now both <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">testing</span></code> point to
the same commit).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In Figure&nbsp;[fig:2], you will see that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> is
pointed to by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></code>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To switch to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">testing</span></code> branch, you type: Does it make sense
that you switch branches by using <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span></code>? What other
situations would you use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span></code>? In particular, can you use
it to switch to commits that are unlabeled? For example, if you had
the repository represented in Figure&nbsp;[fig:2], how would the DAG
change if you typed: How would you use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span></code> to switch to
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">testing</span></code> branch? What would happen to the DAG if you did that?</p>
<p>If you had the above repository and issued the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">34ac2</span></code>
command, you would see something like this: Does this message make
sense given what you’ve learned? What do you think it means to be in
a <strong>detached HEAD</strong> state?</p>

<p>Work in pairs for the following. You should each be on your own
computer, but take turns watching each other type and talking through
what you are doing as you work through the questions together.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person A).</strong> Create a new <strong>feature</strong> branch. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> to see what’s going on. If everything looks
alright, it’s time to implement your new feature. For this
feature, you are going to print out the summary information,
rather than the mean.</p>
<p>That is, change the line reading so that it reads Now add and
commit your changes to your local repository.</p>
<p>Let’s say that you have completed the implementation of your new
feature and that you’ve fully tested it. Now you will want to
merge your feature branch back to your master branch. Explain what
each step does in terms of the underlying DAG. Use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">branch</span> <span class="pre">–help</span></code> to see what the option <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span></code> does. How does
this differ from what <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-D</span></code> does?</p>
<p>Take a look at the DAG by typing: Finally, push your new changes
to GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person B).</strong> Create a new <strong>bugfix</strong> branch.</p>
<p>First pull (i.e., fetch+merge) the work that Person A just pushed
to their GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Use git status to see what’s going on. If everything looks
alright, it’s time to create a bugfix branch and fix the bug.</p>
<p>First create and checkout a new branch with one command: Verify
what happened with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">status</span></code>. Then replace <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sin</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cos</span></code>
in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stats.R</span></code>. Save your changes, add the changed file to the
staging area, commit the changes to your repository.</p>
<p>Next merge your feature branch back to your master branch. Explain
what each step does in terms of the underlying DAG. Use
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">merge</span> <span class="pre">–help</span></code> to see what the option <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">–no-ff</span></code> does.</p>
<p>Take a look at the DAG by typing: Can you see a loop that
represents the work on the feature branch? How does this differ
from what happened when Person A merged their feature branch?</p>
<p>If everything looks correct, push your new changes to GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person A).</strong> Make sure you can pull Person B’s changes from
GitHub. Take a look at the DAG by typing:</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>(Person A and Person B).</strong> The feature and bugfix above are
obviously silly. However, in practice, you will often work on new
features that take a long time to complete. While you are working
on the feature, you may find that you decide that the feature is
not as desirable as you first thought. If you work on the feature
in its own branch, you can discard that work easily without the
code polluting your main branch of development.</p>
<p>Similarly, bugfixes themselves may initially seem to require a
significant amount of new code. However, after thinking about the
bug longer, you may realize that a much smaller change resolves
the error. If you were working directly on your main branch, how
would you simply remove all the unnecessary code changes you made?</p>
<p>Can you think of other scenarios where isolating code changes to
separate lines of development would be desirable?</p>

<p>At this point, you should have a basic understanding of how to create
and merge branches as well as how to work with collaborators using
multiple remotes. Unlike many older version control systems, Git’s
model is extremely flexible. The inflexibility of older systems
resulted in everyone using the same workflows. The added flexibility
of Git makes it possible to easily use many different types of
workflows. This means that you will have to make a decision about
which workflow you want to use for every project you version control
with Git.</p>
<p>If you are joining an existing project, you will often just adopt the
workflow that that project uses. If you are starting a new project or
working on project where the workflow is being debated, you will need
to understand the benefits and disadvantages of the various
workflows.</p>
<p>This is a complex issue. Often experience will be required in order
to evaluate the merits of different workflows for different projects.
However, there are several basic workflow styles, which you should
understand.</p>

these workflows make sense? Can you imagine/explain a scenario where
one workflow might be preferred over another?</p>
