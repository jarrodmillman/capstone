<p>Before reading this, you will want to be familiar with the material in the
&#8220;Basics of UNIX&#8221; tutorial and screencast here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials">http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials</a></p>
<p>In this tutorial, I will use a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$</span></code> prompt for bash.  To follow along, you
will need to have bash and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></code> installed on your computer.  If you are
using the BCE VM, you should have everything you need installed.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have git installed, please see <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">this</a> for help.</p>
<p class="last">You will also need a GitHub account to follow some of the examples using git
remotes.  If you don&#8217;t already have one, create a GitHub account <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/join">here</a>.</p>

<p>As a statistician, scientist, or engineer, you will work on projects that
include code, data, and text.  For trivially small and short-lived projects,
it may suffice to keep track of the various files mentally.  As the size
and duration of your project grows, you will eventually need to adopt
a system to track everything.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ tree proj1
proj1
├── code
│   ├── analysis.py
│   ├── eda.py
│   └── preprocess.py
├── data
│   └── blob.dat
├── figs
│   └── diagram.png
├── paper
│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── report.bib
│   └── report.tex
└── slides
    └── presentation.md

5 directories, 9 files
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Above I&#8217;ve displayed the directory tree for a project. Now suppose that I have
an idea about an alternative analysis to the one currently implemented in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">proj1/code/analysis.py</span></code>.  I could manually backup the current analysis
script doing something like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cp</span> <span class="pre">analysis.py</span> <span class="pre">analysis.py.orig</span></code>.  And then
start implementing the new analysis in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">analysis.py</span></code>.  While I am still
trying to debug my new analysis script, my advisor suggests a third alternative
approach, so now I create a third version <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">analysis-advisor.py</span></code>.  The new
analysis methods each require that I conduct different preprocessing
steps, so now I create the following new files: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preprocess-new.py</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preprocess-advisor.py</span></code>.  Now I just need to remember that
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preprocess-new.py</span></code> goes with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">analysis.py</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preprocess.py</span></code> goes with
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">analysis.py.orig</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">preprocess-advisor.py</span></code> goes with
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">analysis-advisor.py</span></code>.</p>
<p>It is easy to further complicate this example.  For instance, what if you are
working on this project with several colleagues.  Each member will want their
own copy of the project and you will need a mechanism to share the files with
one another.  You might consider sharing the project using something like
Dropbox.  However, this will require care as it can be difficult to determine
which changes will be synced when two people edit the same file at the same
time.</p>
<p>Instead of manually trying to keep track of the changes you&#8217;ve made to code,
data, and documents as indicated above, version control software helps you
automate and manage this process. This has several benefits:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>allowing you to easily go back to earlier versions;</li>
<li>allowing you to have multiple version you can switch between;</li>
<li>allowing you to easily separate tentative new directions into different
branches of work, which you can later discard or merge back into
your main line of development;</li>
<li>allowing you to share work easily without worrying about conflicts; and</li>
<li>providing built-in backup.</li>
</ul>
<p>To see how this works, we will now consider the basic operation of a popular
and powerful version control system (VCS) called Git.  First, we will need to
develop some basic vocabulary needed to discuss how Git works.  Then we will
see how to use Git locally as a single-user using a linear workflow.  We will
then see how to use branches rather than following a simple linear workflow.
Finally, we will discuss using remotes instead of just working locally including
a short discussion of collaborative development with one shared remote.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">VCS come in two main architectures: client-server (e.g., CVS, Subversion)
and distributed (e.g., Mercurial, <strong>Git</strong>).  In the client-server
architecture, there is one master repository and everyone working
on the repository has their own minimal local copy of the master
repository.  In the distributed model, every repository is a complete
repository and there are mechanisms for incorporating changes
from remote repositories into a local repository.</p>

<p>The <strong>working tree</strong> (or directory) is the tree of files you are working on in
the current directory. In the example above, we started with this working
tree:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>proj1
├── code
│   ├── analysis.py
│   ├── eda.py
│   └── preprocess.py
├── data
│   └── blob.dat

│   ├── Makefile
│   ├── report.bib
│   └── report.tex
└── slides
    └── presentation.md
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A <strong>commit</strong> is a <em>snapshot</em> of an entire directory tree at a given point in
time, some metadata (e.g., reference to previous commits, authors name), and an
identifier (this is called a hash and will be discussed below).  Returning to
the above example, you would make a <strong>commit</strong> corresponding to the original
state of the directory tree, which I listed.  Committing the directory tree
as listed above will allow us to return to this exact state later (by <strong>checking
out</strong> that commit&#8212;as we will see&#8212;the working tree changed to contain
exactly the files and directories that we originally committed).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/commit_anatomy.png"><img alt="Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License." src="../_images/commit_anatomy.png" style="width: 70%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Here is a schematic representation of a commit.  The commit, which I
refer to as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">98ca9..</span></code>, has some metadata (i.e., author name and committer
name) as well as a pointer to the entire directory tree.</span></p>
<div class="legend">

</div>
<p>A <strong>repository</strong> is essentially a group of <em>linked</em> commits, which form a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), as well as a set of references to specific
commits (we refer to these references to commits as <strong>heads</strong>).  As part of the
metadata of each commit, we include references to 0 or more parent commits.
The initial commit of each repository has 0 parents.  Each subsequent commit is
proceeded by 1 or more commits.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/threecommits.png"><img alt="Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License." src="../_images/threecommits.png" style="width: 70%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">This is a schematic representation of three commits in a linear
workflow.  The first commit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">98ca9..</span></code> has no parents and Snapshot
A contains all the files and directory structure that was in
working tree when the project was started.  Additional files
were added or changed and a new commit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">34ac2..</span></code> was made containing
all the files and directories corresponding to the new state
of the working tree.  This new commit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">34ac2..</span></code> has one parent
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">98ca9..</span></code>, which it points to.  Continuing in this manner,
a new commit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f30ab..</span></code> is made on top of the second commit
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">34ac2..</span></code>.</span></p>
<div class="legend">

</div>
<p>Again returning to our example, the initial <strong>commit</strong> might correspond to the
the original state of the directory tree.  Then when you begin implementing
your new analysis method, you don&#8217;t need to make any copies of the previous
files (i.e., there is no need to execute <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cp</span> <span class="pre">analysis.py</span> <span class="pre">analysis.py.orig</span></code>).
Since they are already committed, you can always access the original state of
the repository by checking out the original commit.  To proceed you would
simply make the necessary edits to the files in your directory tree and then
when you are satisfied with your changes you make a new commit.  This new
commit will correspond to a snapshot of the entire directory tree with all the
edits you&#8217;ve made to it since the original commit.  To keep track of the
history of the project, the new commit will include a reference to the original
commit as its parent.  Now when your advisor suggests the alternative analysis,
you could checkout the original commit, implement the new method, and commit
your changes including a reference to the original commit as its sole parent.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to understand how Git keeps track of commits. To reference a
commit, Git uses a <strong>hash</strong>.  Hashing provides a way to have a fixed-length
identifier for a given set of information, such as a file or set of files. The
identifier is not guaranteed to be unique, but under normal circumstances,
it will always be unique.</p>
<p>To make this concrete, consider the following toy &#8220;implementation&#8221; in R:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">library</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;digest&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># first commit</span>
<span class="n">data1</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="s1">&#39;This is the start of my paper.&#39;</span>
<span class="n">meta1</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="s1">&#39;date: 8/20/15&#39;</span>
<span class="n">hash1</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">digest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">meta1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">algo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;sha1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># second commit, linked to the first</span>
<span class="n">data2</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Some more text in my paper...&#39;</span>
<span class="n">meta2</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="s1">&#39;date: 8/20/15&#39;</span>
<span class="c1"># Note we add the parent hash here!</span>
<span class="n">hash2</span> <span class="o">&lt;-</span> <span class="n">digest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">meta2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">hash1</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">algo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;sha1&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first hash is a cryptographic signature of the content of the commit
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data1</span></code>) and its metadata (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meta1</span></code>). Since this is the first commit to the
repository, there is no parent commit that proceeds it.  However, the second
hash is a cryptographic signature of the content of the commit (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">data2</span></code>) and
its metadata (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">meta2</span></code>) and&#8212;importantly&#8212;the first hash (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hash1</span></code>).</p>
<p>And here it is in Python:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sha</span>

<span class="c1"># first commit</span>
<span class="n">data1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;This is the start of my paper.&#39;</span>
<span class="n">meta1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;date: 8/20/15&#39;</span>
<span class="n">hash1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sha</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sha</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">meta1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hexdigest</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># second commit, linked to the first</span>
<span class="n">data2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Some more text in my paper...&#39;</span>
<span class="n">meta2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;date: 8/20/15&#39;</span>
<span class="c1"># Note we add the parent hash here!</span>
<span class="n">hash2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sha</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">sha</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">meta2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">hash1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hexdigest</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now that we have developed some basic vocabulary, let&#8217;s start using Git.
To begin, we will use Git in the simplest way possible&#8212;as a single-user
working linearly with no remotes.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t done so already, you will want to configure Git before
proceeding.  You will want to do something like the following from
your Bash shell:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git config --global user.name &quot;Jarrod Millman&quot;
$ git config --global user.email &quot;millman@berkeley.edu&quot;
$ git config --global core.editor /usr/bin/gedit
</pre></div>
</div>
<p class="last">The first two lines tell Git who you are (obviously you should use
your own name and email address rather than mine).  The final command
tells Git which text editor you wish to use.  You should use whatever
text editor you prefer.  For instance, I use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/usr/bin/vim</span></code>. The
most popular text editors on Linux are <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vim</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">emacs</span></code>. If
you aren&#8217;t familiar with them at this point, you will probably
want to use a simple text editor like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gedit</span></code>, which should already
be installed on your BCE VM.  You can learn
more about <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gedit</span></code> here: <a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/gedit">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/gedit</a></p>

<p>From a Bash shell, type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span></code> (or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">help</span></code>) to see a list of the &#8216;core&#8217;
commands, which will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git
usage: git &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]

The most commonly used git commands are:
   add        Add file contents to the index
   config     Get and set options
   clone      Clone a repository
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   init       Create an empty Git repository
   log        Show commit logs
   push       Update remote
   status     Show the working tree status
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will see more commands than this, but these are the ones we cover in the
remainder of this tutorial.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get a repository.  First you can <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">clone</span></code> an existing
repository.  Second you can create a new one.</p>
<p>In this section, you will see how to create a new empty repository, add
content, and commit your work to repository.  You will also see how to look at
a log of what you&#8217;ve done, see what you&#8217;ve changed, as well as delete and
rename files.</p>
<div class="section" id="git-init-create-an-empty-repository">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13"><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">init</span></code>: create an empty repository</a><a class="headerlink" href="#git-init-create-an-empty-repository" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First create an empty repository using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">init</span></code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd ~/src
$ git init demo
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that I am working in my <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/src</span></code> directory.  It is common to use a
specific directory for all your local repositories.  I tend to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src</span></code>, but
you might use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">code</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vc</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">work</span></code>, or something similar.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at what git did:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd demo
$ ls -la
$ ls -l .git
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">init</span> <span class="pre">demo</span></code> command should have created a new directory called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">demo</span></code> in your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/src</span></code> directory.  Inside <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/src/demo</span></code> you will see
another directory <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git</span></code>.  The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git</span></code> directory is where git stores the
repository. Every time you stage some work or commit it, a snapshot of
your working tree is stored in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git</span></code> directory.  You should avoid
modifying this directory manually.  Since all the repository information is
stored in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git</span></code> directory, you can turn your working tree back into
a normal directory tree by deleting the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.git</span></code> directory.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s edit our first file in the test directory with a text editor.  I&#8217;m
doing it programmatically here for automation purposes, but you&#8217;d normally be
editing by hand:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ echo &quot;My first bit of text&quot; &gt; file1.txt

<p>Now we can tell git about this new file using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">add</span></code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git add file1.txt

<p>We can now ask git about what happened with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">status</span></code>:</p>

<p>Now we are ready to commit our changes:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git commit -m &quot;This is our first commit&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the commit above, we used the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> flag to specify a message at the
command line. If we don&#8217;t do that, git will open the editor we specified
in our configuration above and require that we enter a message. By
default, git refuses to record changes that don&#8217;t have a message to go
along with them (though you can obviously &#8216;cheat&#8217; by using an empty or
meaningless string: git only tries to facilitate best practices, it&#8217;s
not your nanny).</p>
<p>While many people use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-m</span></code> flag routinely, I would recommend configuring
your editor and then using it to add your commit message.  This has the
advantage that while you are writing your commit message, you can see the list
of files that you are committing.  While this may seem inconsequential, I&#8217;ve
found that this practice is helpful and doesn&#8217;t slow me down.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s do a little bit more work. Again, in practice you&#8217;ll be editing

<p>While the basic pattern is <em>work, add, commit, and repeat</em>,  I tend to
repeatedly add my work to the staging area before I finally commit it.  This
allows me to effectively keep saving my work, but only committing it once I
have finished and tested a chunk of work.  The importance of keeping track of
your changes is not because you want to track the possibly circuitous route you
happened to take while implementing a new feature in your code or revising your
text.  Rather, the goal is to track the logical and conceptual steps that led
to your new feature or revision. As you learn more about git, you will learn
how to rebase your changes on a new history, to rewrite your history, as well
as how to break your commits into many commits.  These features allow you to
carefully construct the history of your changes into a comprehensible account
that leads the reader of your history to an understanding of what you have
done. This makes it easier for you to understand what you&#8217;ve done when you try
to figure it out months later.  It also makes it easier for your collaborators
to understand what you&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>Understanding the difference between the working tree, the staging area (or
index), and the repository can be confusing at first.  The <em>working tree</em> or
<em>working directory</em> is your local directory on the filesystem. The staging area
(or <em>index</em>) reflects your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">rm</span></code>, etc. changes that have been
staged but not committed. The repository reflects your commits.</p>
<p>Consider the schematic representation below.  You work in your working
tree (or directory).  Periodically, as you complete little chunks of work,
you add your work to the staging area.  (Generally, speaking a
staging area is a place where you prepare to do something.  For instance,
if you wish to go on a hike in the East Bay Regional Park system with
some of your friends, you could meet in a staging area&#8212;a parking lot
beside an entrance to one of the paths.  The purpose of the staging area
in this instance is to provide a place where you and your friends can
coordinate before beginning your walk.)  Once you&#8217;ve got a logical chunk
of work completed and staged, you can then commit it.  Each commit has
a unique hash.  You can go back to the exact snapshot of your working
tree at the time you committed it by checking it out using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span>
<span class="pre">checkout</span></code> command, which we will discuss below.</p>

<p>While <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> is used to add files to the list git tracks, we must

<p>To understand what a Git <strong>branch</strong> is, we first need to revisit the idea of a
<strong>head</strong>.  As discussed above, Git labels every commit with cryptographic
signature called a hash.  These hashes can be considered to uniquely identify
every commit and are used to verify that the contents of the commit and history
of the commit are correct.  While there are many advantages to using these
hashes to label the commits, it is unlikely that you will remember these
hashes.  This is where heads come into play.  A head is an easy to remember
label (e.g., <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">feature1</span></code>) that references a commit.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id4">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/masterbranch.png"><img alt="Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License." src="../_images/masterbranch.png" style="width: 50%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">By default every repository has a head called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>. In this
figure <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> refers to the commit whose has begins
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f30ab</span></code>.  This allows you to refer to the commit by the easy
to remember name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> rather than <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f30ab</span></code>.</span></p>
<div class="legend">

</div>
<p>A repository can contain any number of heads.  At any point in time,
your current working tree will correspond to a specific commit.
By convention, we refer to this commit with the name <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HEAD</span></code> (note
the use of all capital letters to distinguish this from the generic
notion of head).</p>
<p>In Git, the notions of branch and head are essentially identical. Each
branch is associated with exactly one head and each head corresponds
to one branch.  However, we use the term head to refer exclusively
to a label on exactly one commit; while the term branch may also
sometimes be used to refer not only to the commit labeled by the
head but that commit and all the commits that proceed it in the
repository.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id5">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/HEAD_testing.png"><img alt="Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License." src="../_images/HEAD_testing.png" style="width: 50%;" /></a>

<p>Once new commits are made on a branch, HEAD and the branch label move

<div class="legend">
Credit: ProGit book, by Scott Chacon, CC License.</div>
</div>
<p>This allows the history of both branches to diverge. For instance, your master
branch may be were you integrate new features and bug fixes into the main
trunk of development.  If you have a bug report (perhaps labeled issue 53)
that you are trying to fix, you might create a branch (labeled iss53). While
you are preparing a fix for issue 53, the main trunk gains another bug fix
or feature.</p>

</div>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed fixing issue 53 on branch iss53, you want to
integrate your work back into the main trunk represented by the master
branch.  The process of integrating your work is called merging
and often happens automatically.  Once the iss53 branch has been merged
back into the master branch, you can continue with a unified line of
development:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s now illustrate all of this with a concrete example. Let&#8217;s get our
bearings first:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git status

<p>We are now going to try two different routes of development: on the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code> branch we will add one file and on the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">experiment</span></code> branch,
which we will create, we will add a different one. We will then merge
the experimental branch into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.</p>
<p>Create and work on an experimental branch:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git branch experiment

$ git add file-newname.txt

<p>We are now going to introduce the concept of a <strong>remote</strong> repository: a
pointer to another copy of the repository that lives on a different
location. This can be simply a different path on the filesystem or a
server on the internet.</p>
<p>For this discussion, we&#8217;ll be using remotes hosted on the
<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a> service, but you can equally use
other services like <a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://gitorious.org">Gitorious</a> as well as host your own.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git remote -v
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Since the above cell didn&#8217;t produce any output after the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">remote</span> <span class="pre">-v</span></code> call, it means we have no remote repositories
configured. We will now proceed to do so.</p>
<p>Once logged into GitHub, go to
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/new">new repository page</a> and make a
repository called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test</span></code>. Do <strong>not</strong> check the box that says
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Initialize</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">repository</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">README</span></code>, since we already have an
existing repository here. That option is useful when you&#8217;re starting
first at GitHub and don&#8217;t have a repository made already on a local computer.</p>
<p>We can now follow the instructions from the next page:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:jarrodmillman/test.git
$ git push -u origin master
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s see the remote situation again:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git remote -v
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can now <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jarrodmillman/test">see this repository publicly on
GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how this can be useful for backup and syncing work between two
different computers. I&#8217;ll simulate a 2nd computer by working in a
different directory...</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd ~/src/
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here I clone my &#8216;test&#8217; repository but with a different name, test2,
to simulate a 2nd computer:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git clone git@github.com:jarrodmillman/test.git test2
$ cd test2
$ pwd
$ git remote -v
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s now make some changes in one &#8216;computer&#8217; and synchronize them on
the second.</p>
<p>First I switch directories to simulate working on computer #2:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd ~/src/test2
$ echo &quot;More new content on my experiment&quot; &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m &quot;More work, on machine #2&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we put this new work up on the GitHub server so it&#8217;s available from
the internet:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git push
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now let&#8217;s fetch that work from machine #1.  Again, I first change directories
to simulate working from my other machine:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cd ~/src/demo
$ git pull

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id23">Conflict management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#conflict-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While git is very good at merging, if two different branches modify the
same file in the same location, it simply can&#8217;t decide which change
should prevail. At that point, human intervention is necessary to make
the decision. Git will help you by marking the location in the file that
has a problem, but it&#8217;s up to you to resolve the conflict. Let&#8217;s see how
that works by intentionally creating a conflict.</p>
<p>We start by creating a branch and making a change to our experiment
file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git branch trouble
$ git checkout trouble
$ echo &quot;This is going to be a problem...&quot; &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m &quot;Changes in the trouble branch&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And now we go back to the master branch, where we change the <em>same</em>
file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git checkout master
$ echo &quot;More work on the master branch...&quot; &gt;&gt; experiment.txt
$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m &quot;Mainline work&quot;``
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So now let&#8217;s see what happens if we try to merge the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">trouble</span></code> branch
into <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">master</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git merge trouble
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what git has put into our file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat experiment.txt
Some crazy idea
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
More work on the master branch...
=======
This is going to be a problem...
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trouble
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point, we go into the file with a text editor, decide which
changes to keep, and make a new commit that records our decision. To
automate my edits, I use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sed</span></code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ sed -i &#39;/^&lt;/d&#39; experiment.txt
$ sed -i &#39;/^&gt;/d&#39; experiment.txt
$ sed -i &#39;/^=/d&#39; experiment.txt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve now made the edits, in this case I decided that both pieces of text
were useful, so I just accepted both additions:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ cat experiment.txt
Some crazy idea
More work on the master branch...
This is going to be a problem..
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let&#8217;s then make our new commit:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>$ git add experiment.txt
$ git commit -m &quot;Completed merge of trouble, fixing conflicts along the way&quot;
$ git slog

a merge tool is a piece of software that conforms to a basic interface

<li>Bob clones Alice&#8217;s repository.</li>
<li>Bob makes changes to a file and commits them locally.</li>
<li>Bob pushes his changes to GitHub.</li>
<li>Alice pulls Bob&#8217;s changes into her own repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will have both parties make non-conflicting changes each, and
commit them locally. Then both try to push their changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Alice adds a new file, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">alice.txt</span></code> to the repository and commits.</li>
<li>Bob adds <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">bob.txt</span></code> and commits.</li>
<li>Alice pushes to GitHub.</li>
<li>Bob tries to push to GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happened?  Read the error message and hint provided by git to see
if you can figure it out.</p>
<p>Since Alice and Bob are working on the same branch of the repository, the
problem is that Bob&#8217;s branch doesn&#8217;t have Alice&#8217;s most recent commit, which the
branch on GitHub has since Alice pushed it already.  In order to push a branch
to a remote, you have to already have the entire history on the remote in your
local repository.  The solution is for Bob to first pull the changes (pull in
git is really fetch+merge), and then push again.  When Bob pulls from his
GitHub remote, he will merge Alice&#8217;s history into his repository.  Now when he
attempts to push, his repository contains all the history that the remote
repository on GitHub has.</p>
