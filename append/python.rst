.. note::
   This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with at least one high-level
   language like R or Matlab.  If you don't have this background, you may
   want to read the first 3 sections of the `Python tutorial
   <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html>`_---`Whetting Your
   Appetite <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/appetite.html>`_,
   `Using the Python Interpreter <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html>`_,
   and `An Informal Introduction to Python
   <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html>`_---first.

   It also assumes you have Python (and IPython) installed on your computer.  If
   you have Python installed---but not IPython, you can install it by typing::

      $ pip install ipython

   For additional help with installation, please see the `IPython installation
   page <http://ipython.org/install.html>`_.

While working through this tutorial, you should type the example code snippets
at an interactive Python terminal. I recommend using either the IPython shell
or the IPython notebook. To start an IPython shell, type the following at a
BASH prompt:

.. code:: bash

    $ ipython

To start an IPython notebook, type

.. code:: bash

    $ ipython notebook

Objects
~~~~~~~

Everything is an object in Python. Roughly, this means that it can be tagged
with a variable and passed as an argument to a function. Often it means that
everything has *attributes* and *methods*.

Certain objects in Python are mutable (e.g., lists, dictionaries), while other
objects are immutable (e.g., tuples, strings, sets). Many objects can be
composite (e.g., a list of dictionaries or a dictionary of lists, tuples, and
strings).

Variables
~~~~~~~~~

Variables are not their values in Python (think "I am not my name, I am the
person named XXX"). You can think of variables as tags on objects. In
particular, variables can be bound to an object of one type and then reassigned
to an object of another type without error.

Modules, files, packages, import
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While you will often explore things from an interactive Python prompt, you will
save your code in files for reuse as well as to document what you’ve done. You
can use Python code saved in a plain text file from a Python prompt or other
files by importing it. Typically, this is done at the top of a file (if you are
working at a prompt, you just need to import it before you want to use the
functionality).

Here are some examples of importing:

.. code:: python

    import math
    from math import cos
    import numpy as np
    import scipy as sp
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Style
~~~~~

Adopting standard coding conventions is good practice.

-  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#intermezzo-coding-style
-  https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt
-  http://matplotlib.org/devel/coding_guide.html

The first link above is the official "Style Guide for Python Code", usually
referred to as PEP8 (PEP is an acronym for Python Enhancement Proposal). There
are a couple of potentially helpful tools for helping you conform to the
standard. The `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`__ package that
provides a commandline tool to check your code against some of the PEP8
standard conventions. Similarly, `autopep8
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8>`__ provides a tool to automatically
format your code so that it conforms to the PEP8 standards. I have used both a
little and they seem to work fairly well.

The last two links discuss the NumPy docstring [1]_ standard. Let’s briefly see
how you might benefit from NumPy docstrings in practice.

.. code:: python

    In [1]: import numpy as np

    In [2]: np.ndim?
    Type:        function
    String form: <function ndim at 0x7fcabd864938>
    File:        /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.py
    Definition:  np.ndim(a)
    Docstring:
    Return the number of dimensions of an array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.  If it is not already an ndarray, a conversion is
        attempted.

    Returns
    -------
    number_of_dimensions : int
        The number of dimensions in `a`.  Scalars are zero-dimensional.

    See Also
    --------
    ndarray.ndim : equivalent method
    shape : dimensions of array
    ndarray.shape : dimensions of array

    Examples
    --------
    >>> np.ndim([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
    2
    >>> np.ndim(np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]))
    2
    >>> np.ndim(1)
    0

**Exercises**

-  What happens if you type ``np.ndim??`` (i.e., use two question
   marks)?

-  Type ``np.tril?`` at an IPython prompt. What does ``np.tril`` do?

-  Type ``np.ndarray?`` at an IPython prompt. Briefly skim the
   docstring. ``ndarray`` is the basic datastructure provided by NumPy.
   We will examine it in much more detail in the next chapter.

-  Type ``np.`` followed by the ``<Tab>`` key at an IPython prompt.
   Choose two or three of the completions and use ``?`` to view their
   docstrings. In particular, pay attention to the examples provided
   near the end of the docstring and see whether you can figure out how
   you might use this functionality. Use on them as well.

.. note:: Python 2 vs. 3
  Python 3 is a new version of Python, which is incompatible with Python
  2. We will use Python 2, but Python 3 is the future.
  Due to the large installed codebase of Python 2, the transition will
  take years.
  
  If you are writing new Python code at this point, require Python 2.7 as
  the minimum support version. You should also import the following
  functionality from the ``__future__`` module.
  
  .. code:: python
  
      from __future__ import (absolute_import,
                              division,
                              print_function,
                              unicode_literals)
  
  While we will be using Python 2 in this tutorial, in the near future
  you may consider using the ``future`` package. [2]_ The idea is that by
  using this package and adding a few imports to the top of your Python
  modules you can write "predominantly standard, idiomatic Python 3 code
  that then runs similarly on Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.3+."

Numbers
~~~~~~~

Python has integers, floats, and complex numbers with the usual operations
(beware: division).

.. code:: python

    In [1]: 2/3
    Out[1]: 0

    In [2]: from __future__ import division

    In [3]: 2/3
    Out[3]: 0.6666666666666666

    In [4]: x = 1.1

    In [5]: x.
    x.as_integer_ratio  x.hex               x.real
    x.conjugate         x.imag              
    x.fromhex           x.is_integer        

    In [5]: x * 2
    Out[5]: 2.2

    In [6]: x**2
    Out[6]: 1.2100000000000002

    In [7]: 100000**10
    Out[7]: 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000L

    In [8]: 100000**100
    Out[8]: 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000L

    In [9]: cos(0)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-6-edaadd132e03> in <module>()
    ----> 1 cos(1)

    NameError: name 'cos' is not defined

    In [10]: import math

    In [11]: math.cos(0)
    Out[11]: 1.0

    In [12]: math.cos(math.pi)
    Out[12]: -1.0

    In [13]: (type(1), type(1.1), type(1+2j))
    Out[13]: (int, float, complex)

The above line is an example of a composite object called a tuple, which we
will discuss more below. At an IPython prompt, use ``type?`` to see what
``type`` does.

The ``math`` package in the standard library includes many additional
numerical operations.

.. code:: python

    In [14]: math.
    math.acos       math.degrees    math.fsum       math.pi
    math.acosh      math.e          math.gamma      math.pow
    math.asin       math.erf        math.hypot      math.radians
    math.asinh      math.erfc       math.isinf      math.sin
    math.atan       math.exp        math.isnan      math.sinh
    math.atan2      math.expm1      math.ldexp      math.sqrt
    math.atanh      math.fabs       math.lgamma     math.tan
    math.ceil       math.factorial  math.log        math.tanh
    math.copysign   math.floor      math.log10      math.trunc
    math.cos        math.fmod       math.log1p      
    math.cosh       math.frexp      math.modf

**Exercises**

Using the section on "Built-in Types" from the official "The Python
Standard Library" reference (follow the first link at the top of
this section), figure out how to compute:

#. :math:`3 \le 4`,

#. :math:`3 \mod 4`,

#. :math:`|-4|`,

#. :math:`\left(  \left \lceil \frac{3}{4} \right \rceil \times4\right)^3 \mod{2}`, and

#. :math:`\sqrt{-1}`.

**Questions**

#. How do you get the list of completions for ``x.``?

#. What is the difference in the old and new behavior of division?

#. Read the "Truth Value Testing" and "Boolean Operations" subsections
   at the top of the "Built-in Types" section of the Library reference.
   How does this compare to how R handles things?

Strings
~~~~~~~

Strings are immutable sequences of (zero or more) characters.

**Sequences**

Unlike numbers, Python strings are container objects. Specifically, it
is a sequence. Python has several sequence types including strings,
tuples, and lists. Sequence types share some common functionality, which
we can demonstrate with strings.

-  **Indexing** To see how indexing works in Python let’s use the string
   containing the digits 0 through 9.

   >>> import string
   >>> string.digits
   '0123456789'
   >>> string.digits[1]
   '1'
   >>> string.digits[-1]
   '9'

   Note that indexing starts at 0 (unlike R and Fortran, but like C).
   Also negative integers index starting from the end of the sequence.
   You can find the length of a sequence using the ``len()`` function.

-  **Slicing** Slicing allows you to select a subset of a string (or any
   sequence) by specifying start and stop indices as well as a step,
   which you specify using the ``start:stop:step`` notation inside of
   square braces.


   >>> string.digits[1::2]
   '13579'
   >>> string.digits[9::-1]
   '9876543210'

-  **Subsequence testing**


   >>> '23' in string.digits
   True
   >>> '25' not in string.digits
   True

**String methods**

.. code:: python

    In [1]: string1 = "my string"

    In [2]: string1.
    string1.capitalize  string1.islower     string1.rpartition
    string1.center      string1.isspace     string1.rsplit
    string1.count       string1.istitle     string1.rstrip
    string1.decode      string1.isupper     string1.split
    string1.encode      string1.join        string1.splitlines
    string1.endswith    string1.ljust       string1.startswith
    string1.expandtabs  string1.lower       string1.strip
    string1.find        string1.lstrip      string1.swapcase
    string1.format      string1.partition   string1.title
    string1.index       string1.replace     string1.translate
    string1.isalnum     string1.rfind       string1.upper
    string1.isalpha     string1.rindex      string1.zfill
    string1.isdigit     string1.rjust       

    In [2]: string1.upper()
    Out[2]: 'MY STRING'

    In [3]: string1.upper?
    Type:        builtin_function_or_method
    String form: <built-in method upper of str object at 0x7fa136f8ced0>
    Docstring:
    S.upper() -> string

    Return a copy of the string S converted to uppercase.

    In [4]: string1 + " is your string."
    Out[4]: 'my string is your string.'

    In [5]: "*"*10
    Out[5]: '**********'

    In [6]: string1[3:]
    Out[6]: 'string'

    In [7]: string1[3:4] 
    Out[7]: 's'

    In [8]: string1[4::2]
    Out[8]: 'tig'

    In [9]: string1[3:5] = 'ts'
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-12-d7a58dc91703> in <module>()
    ----> 1 string1[3:5] = 'ts'

    TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

    In [10]: string1.__
    string1.__add__           string1.__len__
    string1.__class__         string1.__lt__
    string1.__contains__      string1.__mod__
    string1.__delattr__       string1.__mul__
    string1.__doc__           string1.__ne__
    string1.__eq__            string1.__new__
    string1.__format__        string1.__reduce__
    string1.__ge__            string1.__reduce_ex__
    string1.__getattribute__  string1.__repr__
    string1.__getitem__       string1.__rmod__
    string1.__getnewargs__    string1.__rmul__
    string1.__getslice__      string1.__setattr__
    string1.__gt__            string1.__sizeof__
    string1.__hash__          string1.__str__
    string1.__init__          string1.__subclasshook__

**Exercises**

At an interactive Python prompt, type
``x = The ant wants what all ants want.``. Using string indexing,
slicing, subsequence testing, and methods, solve the following:

#. Convert the string to all lower case letters (don’t change x).

#. Count the number of occurrences of the substring ``ant``.

#. Create a list of the words occurring in ``x``. Make sure to remove
   punctuation and convert all words to lowercase.

#. Using only string methods on ``x``, create the following string:
   ``The chicken wants what all chickens want.``

#. Using indexing and the ``+`` operator, create the following string:
   ``The tna wants what all ants want.``

#. Do the same thing except using a string method instead.

**Questions**

#. How do the string method’s ``split`` and ``rsplit`` differ? [Hint:
   use ``?`` to view the method’s docstrings.]

#. What happens when you multiple a string by a number? How does this
   relate to the string method ``__mul__``? [Hint: look at the
   docstring.]

#. How does the ``len()`` function know how to find the length of a
   sequence?

#. How do the ``in`` and ``not in`` operators work?

Tuples
~~~~~~

Tuples are immutable sequences of (zero or more) objects. Functions in
Python often return tuples.

.. code:: python

    In [1]: x = 1; y = 2

    In [2]: xy = (x, y)

    In [3]: xy
    Out[3]: (1, 2)

    In [4]: xy[1]
    Out[4]: 2

    In [5]: xy[1] = 3
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-7-b22951f8a33e> in <module>()
    ----> 1 xy[1] = 3

    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

    In [6]: (x, y)
    Out[6]: (1, 2)

    In [7]: x, y
    Out[7]: (1, 2)

**Exercises**

#. Note that ``x, y`` and ``(x, y)`` both print the same string. To see
   why that is assign them to variables and check their type.

#. Create the following ``x=5`` and ``y=6``. Now swap their values. (How
   would you do this in R?)

List
~~~~

Lists are mutable sequences of (zero or more) objects.

.. code:: python

    In [1]: dice = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    In [2]: dice[1::2]
    Out[2]: [2, 4, 6]

    In [3]: dice[1::2] = dice[::2]

    In [4]: dice
    Out[4]: [1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5]

    In [5]: dice*2
    Out[5]: [1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5]

    In [6]: dice+dice[::-1]
    Out[6]: [1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1]

    In [7]: 1 in dice
    Out[7]: True

**Exercises**

#. Create a list of numbers. Reverse the order of the items in the list
   using slicing. Now reverse the order of the items using a list
   method. How does using the method differ from slicing? Do you think
   you think tuples have a method to reverse the order of its items? Why
   or why not? Check to see if you are correct or not.

#. Using a list method sort your numbers. Create a list of strings and
   sort it. Put your list of numbers and strings together in one list
   and sort it. What happened?

Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dictionaries are mutable, unordered collections of key-value pairs.


   >>> students = {"Jarrod Millman": [10, 11, 9],
   ...             "Thomas Kluyver":  [11, 9, 10],
   ...             "Stefan van der Walt": [12, 9, 9],
   ...            }
   >>> students
   {'Thomas Kluyver': [11, 9, 10], 'Stefan van der Walt': [12, 9, 9], 'Jarrod Millman': [10, 11, 9]}
   >>> students.keys()
   ['Thomas Kluyver', 'Stefan van der Walt', 'Jarrod Millman']
   >>> students["Jarrod Millman"]
   [10, 11, 9]
   >>> students["Jarrod Millman"][1]
   11


Sets
~~~~

Sets are immutable, unordered collections of unique elements.

.. code:: python

    In [1]: x =  {1, 2, 4, 1, 4}

    In [2]: x
    Out[2]: {1, 2, 4}

    In [3]: x.
    x.add                          x.issubset
    x.clear                        x.issuperset
    x.copy                         x.pop
    x.difference                   x.remove
    x.difference_update            x.symmetric_difference
    x.discard                      x.symmetric_difference_update
    x.intersection                 x.union
    x.intersection_update          x.update
    x.isdisjoint

Built-in functions
------------------

-  https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html

Python has several built-in functions (you can find a full list using
the link above). We’ve already used a few (e.g.,
``len(), type(), print()``). Here are a few more that we you will find
useful.

zip
~~~

.. code:: python

    In [108]: zip([1, 2], ["a", "b"])
    Out[108]: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]

enumerate
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    In [109]: enumerate(["a", "b"])
    Out[109]: <enumerate at 0x7f5e3e018640>

    In [110]: list(enumerate(["a", "b"]))
    Out[110]: [(0, 'a'), (1, 'b')]

**Question**

-  What do the built-in functions ``abs()``, ``all()``, ``any()``,
   ``dict()``, ``dir()``, ``id()``, ``list()``, and ``set()`` do? Make
   sure to use ``?`` from the IPython prompt as well as looking at the
   documentation in the official Python Standard Library reference (use
   the above link).

Control flow
------------

-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html

If-then-else
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements

.. code:: python

    In [44]: x = 2

    In [45]: if x < 2:
       ....:     print("Yes")
       ....: else:
       ....:     print("No")
       ....:     
    No

For-loops (and list comprehension)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements

-  https://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.0.html#list-comprehensions

.. code:: python

    In [49]: for x in [1,2,3,4]:
       ....:     print(x)
       ....:     
    1
    2
    3
    4

    In [50]: for x in [1,2,3,4]:
       ....:      print(x, end="")
       ....:     
    1234

Building up a list piece-by-piece is a common task, which can easily be
done in a for-loop. List comprehension provide a compact syntax to
handle this task.

.. code:: python

    In [64]: x = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    In [65]: zip(x, x[::-1])
    Out[65]: [(1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1)]

    In [66]: [y for y in zip(x, x[::-1]) if y[0] > y[1]]
    Out[66]: [(3, 2), (4, 1)]

**Exercises**

-  Write a for-loop that produces ``[(3, 2), (4, 1)]`` from ``x``. How
   does it compare to the list comprehension above?

-  Use ``print?`` to see what the ``end`` argument to the print function
   does. Are there any additional arguments to ``print()``? If so, try
   using the additional arguments.

-  Find the section on the ``range()`` function in Python tutorial.
   Rewrite the two for-loops above using it rather than explicitly
   constructing the list of numbers.

-  See what ``[1, 2, 3] + 3`` returns. Try to explain what happened and
   why. In R, when you add a scalar to a vector the result is the
   element-wise addition.

   .. code:: r

       > 3 + c(1,2,3)
       [1] 4 5 6

   Use list comprehension to perform element-wise addition of a scalar
   to a list of scalars.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions

.. code:: python

    In [105]: def add(x, y):
       .....:     return x+y
       .....: 

    In [106]: add(2, 3)
    Out[106]: 5

    In [105]: def add(x, y=1):
       .....:     return x+y
       .....:

    In [106]: add(3)
    Out[106]: 4


Classes
-------

-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html

.. code:: python

    In [224]: class Rectangle(object):
       .....:     def __init__(self, height, width):
       .....:         self.height = height
       .....:         self.weight = width
       .....:     def __repr__(self):
       .....:         return "{0} by {1}".format(self.height, self.width)
       .....:     def area(self):
       .....:         return self.height*self.width
       .....:     

    In [225]: x = Rectangle(10,5)

    In [228]: x
    Out[228]: 10 by 5

    In [229]: x.area()
    Out[229]: 50


Data formats
------------

CSV
~~~

-  https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html

The Python standard library provides a package for reading and writing
CSV files. This is a somewhat low-level library, so in practice you will
often use NumPy, SciPy, or Pandas CSV functionality.

JSON
~~~~

-  https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html

However the JSON package in the standard library is much more useful.

.. code:: python

    In [182]: import json

    In [183]: x = {"name": "Jarrod", "department": "Biostatistics"}

    In [186]: with open("tmp.json", "w") as outfile: 
       .....:     json.dump(x, outfile)
       .....:     

    In [187]: cat tmp.json
    {"department": "Biostatistics", "name": "Jarrod"}

    In [192]: with open("tmp.json") as infile:
       .....:     y = json.load(infile)
       .....:     

    In [193]: y
    Out[193]: {u'department': u'Biostatistics', u'name': u'Jarrod'}

Note that ``cat`` is not a Python statement. IPython is clever enough to
quess that you want it to call out to the underlying operating system.

**Exercise**

-  One of the nice things above the JSON format is that it so well
   structured that it easy for a machine to parse, but simple enough
   that it easy for humans to read. By default ``json.dump`` writes
   everything out to disk without line breaks. For readability purposes,
   use ``json.dump?`` to figure out how to pretty-print the text as well
   as sort it alphabetically by key.

We will use Thomas Kluyver’s web scraping example notebook for this
section. You can view a rendered version of it
`here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals/blob/master/cheat-sheets/Web-Scraping.ipynb>`__.
To get an interactive version of it, you can do the following from your
BASH prompt:

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-fundamentals.git
    $ cd python-fundamentals/cheat-sheets/
    $ ipython notebook Web-Scraping.ipynb

Standard library
----------------

-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/stdlib.html

Python provides a wealth of functionality in its huge standard library.
We’ve already seen several (e.g., math, csv, json). If you need some
functionality the standard library is one of the first places to look.

Here are a couple packages that you may find useful.

os
~~

-  https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/stdlib.html#operating-system-interface

.. code:: python

    In [147]: import os

    In [148]: os.getcwd()
    Out[148]: '/home/jarrod'

    In [149]: pwd
    Out[149]: u'/home/jarrod'

**Exercise**

-  Use ``os?`` and ``dir(os)`` to explore the os package.

re
~~

-  https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html

The ``re`` package provides support for regular expressions.

   Docstrings are an important part of a Python program:

   A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in
   a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring
   becomes the \_\_doc\_\_ special attribute of that object. All modules
   should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes
   exported by a module should also have docstrings. Public methods
   (including the \_\_init\_\_ constructor) should also have docstrings.

   — https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

   Docstrings also allow for the use of doctests.

   The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like
   interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to
   verify that they work exactly as shown.

   — http://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html

   You will probably need to explore the data interactively from and
   IPython prompt and in tandem write your script
